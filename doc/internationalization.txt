1.

Put in your config/locales directory the locales from
http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails/locale/ that You need.

2.

When you want to allow the user to switch the blog lang add something like this
in your blog layout (usually in your themes default.html.erb file):

<div id="lang">
  <%= link_to "pl", { :url => "#", :locale => 'pl_PL' } %> |
  <%= link_to "en", { :url => "#", :locale => 'en_US' } %> |
  <%= link_to "de", { :url => "#", :locale => 'de_DE' } %>
</div>

This feature is experimental and may change in the future.
See app/controllers/application_controller.rb#load_lang for how it works.
